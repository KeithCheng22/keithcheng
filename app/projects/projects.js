        objectives: "Embarking on my second portfolio endeavor marked a pivotal moment in my journey â€” a chance to reflect on how far I've come since my early days crafting with Flask and Python. With this iteration, my aim was clear: to not just demonstrate growth, but to make a bold statement in design and interactivity. That's why I ventured into uncharted territory, embracing the captivating realm of 3D animations using Three.js and the dynamic capabilities of the GSAP animation library.",
        challenges: 'As with learning anything new, the initial learning curve for both three.js and GSAP were daunting. I found it challenging to understand the concepts of 3D animations of Scenes, Camera and Meshes to create 3D models. Not only that, because this was NextJs, I also had to learn a bit of React Three Fiber, and also React Three Drei. Moreover, when it came to animation, I also got introduced to the concepts of Tweens and Timeline, which once again added to the complexity of this project. The culmination of learning so many things at once was surely overwhelming.',
        learning: "Throughout this project, I have gained a better understanding of 3D animations. While I still have much more to learn, this project was a good starting point. I learnt how to use the basics of geometry to create models with Three.js, and to complement the UI using utilities made from open-source project React-Three Drei. With all animations seen in this project, I wanted to elevate the usual animations that is done with standard CSS, and venture more into creative animations, like the bounce effect from the mobile version of the NavBar. Speaking of mobile, this project was a good platform for me to practice my web responsive skills - something which I never considered in my first portfolio. By the way, if you haven't seen what happens if you venture into the 404 Page, give it a try!"
